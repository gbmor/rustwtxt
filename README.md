# rustwtxt &nbsp; [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/gbmor/rustwtxt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/gbmor/rustwtxt) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/gbmor/rustwtxt/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=4DfKP7oHRQ)](https://codecov.io/gh/gbmor/rustwtxt)

A library that makes it easier to interact with `twtxt` status files.
Doesn't quite work yet. Feel free to help hack on it.

## Notes

* `twtxt` is a decentralized microblogging platform based on text files. 
The files are transmitted over `http`. 
* For more information on `twtxt`:

* This project is based on what I learned while making [`getwtxt`](https://github.com/getwtxt)
